## Hbg1010!

Hey I'm Harrison! I do stuff sometimes

Most of my time is currently spent writing c++, but I often use Java and JS/TS!
I think I've come pretty far for only 3 months of learning c++ lol

# what I do:
- I mod games! Specifically Geometry Dash right now, with interest in some other stuff!
- Robotics programming for FRC
- Learning lower level embedded systems 
- Occasional backend programmer
