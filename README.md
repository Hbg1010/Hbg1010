## Hbg1010!

Hey I'm Harrison! I do stuff sometimes

Most of my time is currently spent writing c/c++, but I often use Java, python, and JS/TS!
I can get pretty comfortable with any language if I have a goal in it at least

# what I do:
- I mod games and consoles! I'm Specifically making and contributing to Geometry Dash modding right now, and working on some homebrew in the background
- Robotics programming for FRC
- Learning lower level embedded systems 
- Occasional backend programmer
- Stupid projects for the hell of it, like turning a wiimote into a digital laser pointer and mouse, or
